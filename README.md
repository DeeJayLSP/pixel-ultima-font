![Pixel Ultima Logo](https://github.com/DeeJayLSP/pixel-ultima-font/raw/main/logo/logo-preview.png)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Pixel Ultima is pixelated font made after its author not finding big enough pixel fonts for what he was planning, which included Esperanto characters.

It includes most Latin-1 characters plus Esperanto.

Contributions are currently not accepted since the author doesn't have a way to verify font diffs, but you can make your own modification of it through font editors.

Changelog and contributors info can be found at the FONTLOG file. If you do modify the font, please state it there.
