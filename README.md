Pixel Ultima is a pixel font made after its author searched for a big font that included many characters and ended up not finding one.

It includes most Latin-1 characters, common Cyrillic and Esperanto.

### Contributions

Contributions will only be accepted in the form of Birdfont files, used for the sources, since it's the easiest way to check the diff. Modification on a single style only won't be accepted.

Complains about the font will be accepted in Issues, but don't expect all of them to be accepted. Note that the font having some spacing and clipping issues is **intentional**, since they can be easily fixed by modifying those parameters in your text program (this font was made to work along JF Dot Shinonome 16, so it's necessary). 

Changelog and contributors info can be found at the FONTLOG file. If you do modify the font, please state it there.
