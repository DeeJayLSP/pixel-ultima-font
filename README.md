Pixel Ultima is a pixel font made after its author searched for a big font that included many characters and ended up not finding one.

It includes most Latin-1 characters, common Cyrillic and Esperanto.

### Contributions

Contributions through Pull Requests will only be accepted if both `.ttf` and `.sfd` files are updated, and the change is applied to both styles (except bugfixes on a specific style only).

Complains about the font will be accepted in Issues, but don't expect all of them to be accepted. Note that the font having some spacing and clipping issues is **intentional**, since they can be easily fixed by modifying those parameters in your text program (this font was made to work along JF Dot Shinonome 16, so it's necessary). If you don't like this, you can make a fork of it and fix yourself.

Changelog and contributors info can be found at the FONTLOG file. If you do modify the font, please state it there. If you decide to fork the font, keep the previous entries.
